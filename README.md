### Start the project:
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn rest` to start the mock api
- `yarn serve` to build and serve the app
- `yarn test:unit` to launch unit tests
- `yarn test:e2e` to launch e2e tests

### Can be improved:
- it looks ugly
- e2e tests are ok but messy, could be reorganized
- lots of unit tests are missing
- I gave up fighting the project/editor style confs, so the code style is weird here and there
- some cli generated tools (registerServiceWorker for example) are unused
